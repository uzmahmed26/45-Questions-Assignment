// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, 
// but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
// The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names:string[] = ['Uzma','Ramshah','Aakashah']
let message:string = 'This is my Family'
console.log(names[0]+' '+message)
console.log(names[1]+' '+message)
console.log(names[2]+' '+message)
