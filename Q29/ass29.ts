// Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent 
// if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.

// • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.

// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. 
// If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!

//Create a Array
let favorite_fruits = ["Mango", "Strawberry", "Orange"]


// Using 5 Independent If Statments

if(favorite_fruits.includes("Mango")){
console.log("I Really Like Mangos");
}
if(favorite_fruits.includes("Strawberry")){
    console.log("I Really Like Strawberrys");
}
if(favorite_fruits.includes("Banana")){
    console.log("I Really Like Banana");
    }
 if(favorite_fruits.includes("Orange")){
    console.log("I Really Like Orange");
